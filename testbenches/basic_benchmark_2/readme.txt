Trust the Tuition and Housing Profit: Basic Benchmark 2

Iteratively adds a custom number (x2) up to a custom total (x5), and will store and load the value from memory at a custom milestone.
Stores the sum in memory.

For example, your total could be set as the total revenue made by northwestern from student tuition and housing,
your iterative number could be $100,000, and you could load and store from memory every $3 million. See reg_in for this example in the registers. 

Be careful with using really small iterative numbers and really large totals, as you could end up taking billions of cycles.
